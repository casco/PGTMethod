6. After submiting, the system will provide the participant with a different page from the pool (now it might have somebody else's (anonymous) ideas. 
  * The participant can agree with any of the ideas in the page, adding more detail to it, then submitting.
  * The participant can disagree with any of the ideas in the page, by arguing against it, then submitting.
