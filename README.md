# thinklets-companion
A toolset to support facilitation using the thinklets approach

# Thinklets for divergence - no seeds
## FreeBrainstorm
1. 1 Page for each participant, plus one extra
2. 1 Additional page for each 10 participants
3. Brainstorming question
4. Upon start (facilitator clicking go), each participant receives a different page (empty at first)
5. Participants type an idea (up-to 400 chars) then click submit
6. After submiting, the system will provide the participant with a different page from the pool (now it might have somebody else's (anonymous) ideas. 
  * The participant can agree with any of the ideas in the page, adding more detail to it, then submitting.
  * The participant can disagree with any of the ideas in the page, by arguing against it, then submitting.
  * The participant can contribute a completely new idea, then submitting.
7. The is a time counter at the top. The activity continues until the group runs out of time, or the facilitator says so.

## OnePage 
1. One single page for all users
2. The brainstorming question
3. Participants type an idea (up-to 400 chars) then click submit. The idea is visible to everyone
4. The is a time counter at the top. The activity continues until the group runs out of time, or the facilitator says so.

## ComparativeBrainstorm
1. 1 Page for each participant, plus one extra
2. 1 Additional page for each 10 participants
3. Brainstorming question (more of a problem statement)
4. Upon start (facilitator clicking go), each participant receives a different page (empty at first)
5. Participants type __the best single idea they can think of__ (up-to 400 chars) then click submit and wait.
6. After everyone has submitted, the facilitator choses (or enters) a comparative prompt and submit.
7. The system will provide the participant with a different, non-blank page from the pool (with someone else's ideas on it)
8. The participants now contribute a new idea, that adheres to the comparative promt (for example, an proposal that is cheaper than any of the ideas in the page).
9. The is a time counter at the top. The activity continues until the group runs out of time, or the facilitator says so.

## LeafHopper

## DealersChoice

## Plus-Minus-Interesting
1. Start with a list of ideas to be elaborated
2. Participants can contribute "plus", "minus" arguments for each idea. They can also comment "interesting" remarks on each idea. There are two strategies to assign participants to ideas 
  * Leafhopper: let participants chose where to comment
  * Dealer's choice: the facilitator assigns ideas (or small groups) to partipants. 
 
## Top-five
1. From the results of a generation thinket choose 5 (or other small number)
2. These chosen items are passed onto the next (generation or elaboration thinklet)
3. This process can be iterated until all items are transisioned to the next step or until time is up.
